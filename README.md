# AscendedScout ü¶ñüîç

**Real-time OCR monitoring tool for ARK: Survival Ascended**

AscendedScout is a Python-based screen monitoring application that uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to automatically detect and log player activities and structure destruction events in ARK: Survival Ascended. Perfect for server tribes who want to keep track of what's happening on the server or to not get offline raid as soon as you disconnect.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Player Activity Monitoring**: Detects when players join or leave the server
- **Tribe Member Tracking**: Specifically tracks tribemember activities separately
- **Structure Destruction Alerts**: Monitors and logs when your structures are destroyed
- **Multi-zone Screen Capture**: Monitors different areas of the screen simultaneously
- **Advanced OCR Processing**: Uses multiple color-based filters and preprocessing techniques for accurate text recognition
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Smart timestamp-based deduplication system
- **Automatic Logging**: Organized log files for different types of events

## üîß Requirements

### System Requirements
- Windows (currently configured for Windows paths)
- Python 3.7+
- Tesseract OCR installed

### Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pytesseract mss
```

### External Dependencies
- **Tesseract OCR**: Download and install from [GitHub Tesseract releases](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
  - Default installation path: `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe`
  - Make sure to add Tesseract to your system PATH

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ascendedscout.git
   cd ascendedscout
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Tesseract OCR**:
   - Download from [Tesseract GitHub releases](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases)
   - Install to default location or update the path in the script
   - Ensure English language pack is included

4. **Configure screen regions** (if needed):
   - The script is pre-configured for standard ARK UI positions
   - Modify `mon_top` and `mon_center` coordinates if your setup differs

## üìñ Usage

1. **Launch ARK: Survival Ascended** and get to the main game screen
2. **Run AscendedScout**:
   ```bash
   python ascendedscout.py
   ```
3. **Monitor the console** for real-time detection feedback
4. **Check log files** in the `../logs/` directory:
   - `tribemembers_log.txt` - Tribe member activities
   - `players_log.txt` - General player activities  
   - `center_log.txt` - Structure destruction events

### Stopping the Application
Press `Ctrl+C` to stop monitoring gracefully.

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
ascendedscout/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ascendedscout.py          # Main application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/                     # Generated log files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tribemembers_log.txt  # Tribe member events
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ players_log.txt       # Player join/leave events
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ center_log.txt        # Structure destruction events
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Screen Regions
The script monitors two specific areas of your screen:

- **Top Region** (`mon_top`): Player join/leave notifications
  - Default: `{'top': 0, 'left': 750, 'width': 550, 'height': 100}`
- **Center Region** (`mon_center`): Structure destruction messages
  - Default: `{'top': 211, 'left': 772, 'width': 374, 'height': 539}`

### Tesseract Path
If Tesseract is installed in a different location, update this line:
```python
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
```

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Screen Capture**: Uses MSS (Multi-Screen Shot) to capture specific screen regions
2. **Change Detection**: Compares frames to detect new notifications
3. **OCR Processing**: Multiple preprocessing techniques for different text colors and conditions
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Regex patterns extract player names, actions, and timestamps
5. **Smart Logging**: Deduplication and organized logging prevent spam and maintain clean records

### OCR Processing Pipeline
- **Color-based filtering**: Separate processing for red, blue, and green text
- **Image preprocessing**: Gaussian blur, bilateral filtering, and threshold optimization
- **Multi-method approach**: Combines results from different OCR configurations
- **Text normalization**: Unicode normalization and cleanup for consistent results

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**OCR not detecting text properly**:
- Ensure ARK is running in windowed or borderless windowed mode
- Check that Tesseract is properly installed and in PATH
- Verify screen coordinates match your display setup
- Make sure the game UI scale settings (Join Notifications) is on see the picture below

**High CPU usage**:
- Increase the sleep interval in the main loop (default: 1 second)
- Reduce monitoring region sizes if possible

**False positives/negatives**:
- Check if game UI elements are overlapping monitored regions
- Adjust OCR confidence thresholds
- Update regex patterns for your server's specific messages

### Debug Mode
Add print statements to see raw OCR output:
```python
print(f"[DEBUG OCR] Raw text: {raw_text}")
```
