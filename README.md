# AscendedScout
AscendedScout is a lightweight OCR-powered monitoring tool designed for ARK: Survival Ascended. It automatically scans your game screen in real time, detects key in-game events (e.g., destroyed structures, players joining/leaving, tribe activity), and publishes them to Discord channels for instant alerts.
